### Hello, I'm Patricia

🗺️  I lived back and forth between countries until I landed in France, where I graduated from _Université Paris 7, Denis Diderot_ with a bachelors degree in computer science, followed by a masters in computational linguistics. That was twelve years ago!
👩‍💻 My coding path since then has taken me from Java via UI design to WordPress and then deep into the wide and wonderful world of web technologies, where I have been working as an independent consultant for the past four years. This has given me the chance to approach projects from many angles and under different types of technological and business constraints. I've had the chance to continue learning while solving problems old and new, and to see the web medium as well as the industry evolve in the process.
🌈 By the end of 2022, I itched to get back to some focused work on my own projects, and was happy to be able to do that during a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). This gave me the time and space to develop [Fat Fuzzy Rocks](https://rocks.pages.dev/), a self documenting web tooling project where I work in the open as I continue my dev adventures.
🎨 I've always had a visually creative streak, which I love to mix with my coding work when the occasion is right>
