### Hello, I'm Patricia

- 🗺️  I grew up and lived between countries until I settled in France, where I graduated from _Université Paris 7, Denis Diderot_ with a bachelors degree in computer science, followed by a masters degree in computational linguistics in 2011.
- 👩‍💻 My coding path has taken me from Java via UI design to WordPress and into the wonderful world of the web, where I've focused on gaining deep knowledge of native web platform technologies. I've worked as an independent consultant since 2018, which has given me the opportunity to test and expand my knowledge via a variety of technological approaches and business constraints.
- 🌈 By the end of 2022, I itched to get back to some focused work on my own projects, and was happy to be able to do that during a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). This gave me the time and space to develop [Fat Fuzzy Rocks](https://rocks.pages.dev/), a self documenting web tooling project where I work in the open as I continue my dev adventures.
- 🎨 I've always had a visually creative streak, which I love to mix with my coding work when the occasion is right ✨
